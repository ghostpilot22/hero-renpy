This is a Ren'Py based visual novel, sort of inspired by Slay the Princess. 
It's about a 'hero' set out on a quest, inspired by and critiquing the Hero's Journey "monomyth".
There are timeloops! Or ARE there?
Project is currently on pause as I've gotten interested in other things instead. May or may not pick it back up in the future.
